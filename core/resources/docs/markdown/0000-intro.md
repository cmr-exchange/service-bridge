# Introduction

## CMR

The Common Metadata Repository (CMR) is a high-performance, high-quality,
continuously evolving metadata system that catalogs Earth Science data and
associated service metadata records. These metadata records are registered,
modified, discovered, and accessed through programmatic interfaces leveraging
standard protocols and APIs.

## CMR OPeNDAP

CMR OPeNDAP, and in particular the CMR OPeNDAP API, allows client applications
to integrate core CMR metadata more easily with provider OPeNDAP deployments.
This is done by utilzing stored metadata to create queries that are capable of
extracting associated satellite data and related products directly from
services whose metadata the CMR manages.

To facilitate easy integration of the capability in other applications, CMR
OPeNDAP provides a REST API for generating such queries.

CMR OPeNDAP is deployed here:
